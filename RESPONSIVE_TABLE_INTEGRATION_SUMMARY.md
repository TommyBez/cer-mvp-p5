## Mobile Behavior

### Card View (Default)
- Each table row becomes a card on mobile
- Columns are stacked vertically within each card
- Column order respects priority settings (higher priority = shown first)
- Best for general data browsing

### Horizontal Scroll View
- Table maintains its structure on mobile
- Users can scroll horizontally to see all columns
- Best for data comparison and numeric tables

## Key Features Maintained
- All sorting functionality preserved
- Pagination with configurable items per page
- Custom filtering (existing filters still work)
- All action menus and dropdowns functional
- Status badges and icons display correctly
- Responsive breakpoint at 768px

## Tailwind Implementation
The tables now use Tailwind CSS classes exclusively:
- Removed all custom CSS files (`responsive-table.css`)
- Replaced custom classes with Tailwind utilities
- Mobile cards use `bg-card`, `rounded-lg`, `border` for better appearance
- Improved mobile card layout with proper spacing and styling
- All numeric columns use `text-right font-mono` for better alignment

## Build Status
✅ Project builds successfully with no errors
✅ All table imports have been replaced
✅ No remaining references to old table components

## Next Steps
The responsive tables are now fully integrated and ready for use. They will automatically adapt to mobile screens, providing an optimal viewing experience across all devices.
