## Mobile Behavior

### Card View (Default)
- Each table row becomes a card on mobile
- Columns are stacked vertically within each card
- Column order respects priority settings (higher priority = shown first)
- Best for general data browsing

### Horizontal Scroll View
- Table maintains its structure on mobile
- Users can scroll horizontally to see all columns
- Best for data comparison and numeric tables

## Key Features Maintained
- All sorting functionality preserved
- Pagination with configurable items per page
- Custom filtering (existing filters still work)
- All action menus and dropdowns functional
- Status badges and icons display correctly
- Responsive breakpoint at 768px

## CSS Variables Used
The tables use CSS variables for theming, making them compatible with the existing design system:
- `--background`, `--background-secondary`, `--background-hover`
- `--text-primary`, `--text-secondary`
- `--border-color`, `--border-color-light`
- `--primary-color`

## Build Status
✅ Project builds successfully with no errors
✅ All table imports have been replaced
✅ No remaining references to old table components

## Next Steps
The responsive tables are now fully integrated and ready for use. They will automatically adapt to mobile screens, providing an optimal viewing experience across all devices.
