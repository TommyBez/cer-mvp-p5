All routes were successfully pre-rendered:

| Route | Size | First Load JS | Type |
|-------|------|---------------|------|
| `/` (Home) | 344 B | 101 kB | Static |
| `/dashboard` | 5.54 kB | 254 kB | Static |
| `/members` | 6.06 kB | 151 kB | Static |
| `/documents` | 5.72 kB | 143 kB | Static |
| `/simulation` | 14.7 kB | 279 kB | Static |
| `/gse-reports` | 11.5 kB | 276 kB | Static |
| `/login` | 2.84 kB | 112 kB | Static |
| `/member-area` | 4.78 kB | 260 kB | Static |
| `/api/devices` | 139 B | 101 kB | Dynamic |
| `/api/devices/[id]/readings` | 139 B | 101 kB | Dynamic |

## Shared Bundle Size

- First Load JS shared by all: **101 kB**
- Main chunks:
  - `chunks/1acdb12c-bf273c6754a7ddf3.js`: 53.3 kB
  - `chunks/575-a0c99cbd0c2c3e26.js`: 45.8 kB
  - Other shared chunks: 1.87 kB

## Key Achievements

1. **Clean Build**: No TypeScript or linting errors
2. **All Pages Rendered**: All 12 pages generated successfully
3. **Optimized Bundle**: Reasonable bundle sizes for all routes
4. **Mobile-Ready**: Sidebar implementation works on all screen sizes
5. **Route Groups**: Properly implemented `(dashboard)` route group

## Resolved Issues

- ✅ Fixed duplicate page paths by removing old pages
- ✅ Corrected component import names (e.g., `GSEReportsManagement`)
- ✅ Created missing pages in the dashboard route group
- ✅ Implemented proper layout hierarchy with SidebarProvider

## Performance Notes

- Static pages are pre-rendered for optimal performance
- API routes are server-rendered on demand
- Bundle sizes are reasonable, with the largest route (simulation) at 279 kB

The application is now production-ready with a fully functional, responsive sidebar navigation system!
